			<p>Lack of accessibility for disabled students has been a widespread problem in academia. The root causes are systemic and quite built into the campus. Addressing the root causes directly would be a massive undertaking that would take years. Instead, we aimed to work with the existing infrastructure to help those with mobility issues find accessible routes in an inaccessible campus. </p>
			<p>Our demo site features 17 popular buildings on campus, location tracking, custom access needs for routing (defaults to ADA compliance), customizable display of access features, and step-by-step directions of the shortest route.</p>

			<p>For the define stage, we started with a problem statement before finding insights through design exercises like Point of Views, the 5 Whys, and Empathy Maps.</p>
			<p><em>Problem Statement: I am a student at the U of R with a physical disability.  I'm trying to get around campus with mobility issues, but it can be difficult to find an accessible route because not every building on campus is accessible, elevators and automatic door opener buttons break, and unforeseen, temporary circumstances could require detours.  This makes me feel frustrated, excluded, and possibly cause additional pain depending on specific mobility issues.</em></p>
			<p>We found that the root of the issue is that much of campus was built before ADA regulations and that common issues were broken door buttons or elevators and not knowing where elevators are in buildings.</p>

The questions focused on accessibility on campus, experienced or perceived, with a focus on navigation, common access issues, and the current process of reporting something broken to facilities.  We also asked questions about what mapping applications people currently use and why in order to determine user needs outside of accessibility.</p>
			<p>Our team also met with higher-ups in facilities for our campus to learn about how the ticketing system for repairs works and how our site's report feature can work with the existing system.</p>

The UX team used the reviewed wireframes to create a low-fidelity interactive prototype using Figma.</p>

The coding for the final site may look different from the demo site, as we are currently looking at the Leaflet JS framework for GPS, custom icon, and accessibility features.</p>
			<p>The UX team is creating a high-fidelity prototype on Figma using the feedback we received testing the low-fi version.  The UX team is in close contact with the development team so they can update the prototype as different features are developed.</p>
